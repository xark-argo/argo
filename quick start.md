# Create a Knowledge Base
1. Supported document types: pdf, docx, csv, markdown, txt, yaml, json, etc.

2. Under "Workspace" in the "Knowledge" section, you can create a knowledge base.

3. It's important to choose an appropriate model for parsing the knowledge base as it affects the accuracy of retrieval. Here are two models recommended based on the size of the model and the accuracy for both English and Chinese documents:
a) For English documents: nomic-embed-text
b) For Chinese documents: shaw/dmeta-embedding-zh
c) Other options can be referenced from the model ranking at https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard.

4. In the Bot editing page, add a knowledge base so that when the Bot answers questions, it first performs an RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search in the knowledge base before using the retrieved information to engage in conversation with the user.

5. After adding a knowledge base and starting a conversation, you can see in "Prompt Logs" that the content returned by the knowledge base is appended to the prompt template and fed into the large language model for completion.
